# IMPORTANT INFO

-This repository is a re-upload of the old repo for this project, this is because github pages is not a good testing ground for this sort of app development. Instead we are using glitch to test the app quickly.

-The code currently does not "work" HERE.

-The code does work but the animations currently will not work if the repo is built as a github page as the image assets need to be reformatted to use a local folder in the repo and not we URL's.

-This Repo at the current moment in time is used for version control purposes only!
